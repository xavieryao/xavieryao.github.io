Dash is an amazing documentation browser on macOS, which is recommended by nearly every post about tools for developers and Mac users. Dash costs $24.99, but then we meet Zeal, which *is a simple offline documentation browser inspired by Dash* and is written in Qt.

To avoid unnecessary conflict with Dash, Zeal has been made hard to use on macOS. But with some minor patches you can easily maintain your own build of Zeal.

## Requirements   
 - Qt 5 with QtWebEngine or QtWebView
 - libarchive

## My Environment
 - macOS 10.12.2
 - Qt 5.7.1
 - libarchive

## Build Instructions
 1. Get and install Qt5.
 2. Install libarchive. This step can be done easily by [homebrew](http://brew.sh).
 ```bash
 brew install libarchive
 ```
 3. Get the code of [Zeal](https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal) if you want to build the latest version.
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal.git
 ```
Or clone this patched repository
```
git clone https://github.com/xavieryao/Zeal-macOS.git
```
 4. (Optional) Make some slight modifications to compile on macOS, if you are building the original version source code. You can skip this step if you cloned this repository.

  * Link libarchive. In `src/libs/core/core.pri` add
  ```
  macx: {
      INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/Cellar/libarchive/3.2.2/include
      LIBS += -L/usr/local/Cellar/libarchive/3.2.2/lib -larchive
  }
  ```
  * Link sqlite3. In `/src/libs/util/util.pri` add
  ```
  macx: {
      LIBS += -lsqlite3
  }
  ```

5. Build. In Qt Creator, use `Release` profile and build. You will find a `Zeal.app` if it has been built successfully.

6. Installation. Move `Zeal.app` into `~/Applications`
